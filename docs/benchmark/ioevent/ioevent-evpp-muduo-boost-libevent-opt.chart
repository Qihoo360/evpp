# evpp-0.2.4
# libevent 2.0.21
# muduo v1.0.9
#
# evpp Changed:
# optimized : Delete `space` relative code.
#             -               send(pipes[i * space + 1], "e", 1, 0);
#             +               send(pipes[i * 2 + 1], "e", 1, 0);
# 
# Explaination:
#   1. The `evpp_pipe` is used PipeEventWatcher to implement the benchmark test
#   2. The `evpp_channel` is used FdChannel to implement the benchmark test
# 
# Conclusion :
# 	1. `evpp_pipe`, `evpp_channel` and `libevent` has the similar performance
#   2. The `muduo` has 4.1% higher performance than `evpp_channel`
